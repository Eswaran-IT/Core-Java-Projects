# 📚 Library Management System

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage books, users, and borrow records in a library. The system supports two roles:

- **👨‍💻 Admin**: Can add users, add books, and view all books and users.
- **👩‍🎓 User**: Can view all books and borrow books from the library.

The data is stored in text files (i.e., `books.txt`, `users.txt`, `borrow_records.txt`) for persistence. The system also validates user input using custom validation functions.

## 🔧 Features

- **👨‍💻 Admin Features**:
  - 📖 Add new books to the library.
